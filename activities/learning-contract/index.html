<p>In order for you to flourish in our workshop, what do you need from yourself, your fellow learners, your instructors and the group as a whole? What will you do when/if you are not getting your needs met?  Write one idea per sticky note. Then add each sticky note to your tableâ€™s Modern Agile poster (depicting the four principles).</p>
<p>Have each table share out ideas from their posters. Consolidate them into a master MA poster for the workshop. Roman vote on the contract. (thumbs up=support, thumbs sideways=go with the group, thumbs down=not supporting it - elicit what needs to be there in order to support it.)</p>
