# Contributing to ModernAgile.org

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ModernAgile.org website! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this static website project.

## Quick Start

### First-Time Contributors (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone [repository-url]
cd ModernAgile

# 2. Run the interactive onboarding script
./onboard
```

The `./onboard` script will:
- âœ… Check your system prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Git)
- âœ… Set up all project scripts with proper permissions  
- âœ… Optionally pre-install test dependencies
- âœ… Guide you through next steps
- âœ… Optionally start the development server

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone [repository-url]
cd ModernAgile

# 2. Start the development server
./run

# 3. Run tests (in another terminal)
./run_tests
```

## Project Overview

The ModernAgile.org website is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website that promotes Modern Agile principles. The site includes:

- Main website content (`index.html`)
- Specialized pages (analytics, chartering, evolutionary design, flow)
- Interactive JavaScript components (`FancyList.js`, `LearnMore.js`)
- Data-driven content sections (cheat sheets, learn more entries, upcoming events)
- Automated testing with QUnit and Grunt

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for version control

That's it! The `./run` and `./run_tests` scripts handle all other dependencies automatically.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd ModernAgile
   ```

2. **Start the development server** (recommended)
   ```bash
   ./run
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Start a Node.js server on `http://localhost:8080`
   - Automatically open your browser
   - Serve all files with proper MIME types
   - Enable CORS for development
   - Show real-time request logs

3. **Alternative server options** (if you prefer):
   ```bash
   # Node.js http-server
   npx http-server . -p 8080 -o --cors
   
   # Python 3 (basic)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Any other static web server
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Content Updates

#### Data-Driven Content
The easiest way to contribute is by updating the data files:

- **Learn More entries**: Edit `data/learnMoreEntries.js`
- **Cheat sheets**: Edit `data/cheatSheetEntries.js`  
- **Upcoming events**: Edit `data/upcomingEventsEntries.js`

These changes will automatically appear on the website when deployed.

#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript Changes
For other modifications, you'll need to edit:
- `index.html` - Main page structure
- `css/*.css` - Styling (main.css, bootstrap customizations, etc.)
- `js/*.js` - Interactive components

### Testing

#### Running Tests
Before submitting changes, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Recommended: Use the automated test runner
./run_tests

# This script will:
# - Check and install all required dependencies
# - Set up the test environment automatically
# - Run the full test suite with detailed output
# - Handle any dependency issues
```

**Manual testing** (if needed):
```bash
# Install dependencies first
cd tests && npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli

# Run tests manually
cd .. && grunt --base tests --gruntfile tests/Gruntfile.js

# Run with watch mode during development
grunt watch --base tests --gruntfile tests/Gruntfile.js
```

#### Test Structure
- Tests are written using QUnit
- Test files are located in the `tests/` directory
- Main test file: `tests/FancyList-tests.html`
- Tests focus on the `FancyList.js` component functionality

**Note**: The current test suite needs maintenance. Some tests may not work properly and require rework to be valid tests of the FancyList component.

#### Continuous Integration
- The project uses Travis CI for automated testing
- Tests run automatically on pull requests
- Deployment happens automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch

### JavaScript Components

#### FancyList Component
The main interactive component (`js/FancyList.js`) provides:
- Paginated list display
- Category filtering
- Responsive grid layout
- Analytics event tracking

When modifying this component:
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Update tests accordingly
- Test pagination and filtering functionality
- Verify responsive behavior

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and formatting
- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred)
- Add comments for complex functionality
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility (modern browsers)

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single change

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Test your changes** locally
4. **Run the test suite** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of changes

### What to Include in Pull Requests
- Description of the change and why it's needed
- Screenshots for visual changes
- Test results confirmation
- Any breaking changes or migration notes

## Deployment

The project has automated deployment configured:
- Changes to the main branch automatically deploy to production
- Deployment typically takes a few minutes to complete
- Uses Cloud Foundry (Pivotal) for hosting

## Translation and Media Kits

For MA Wheel translations, see the separate [Template Engine](git@github.com:modernagile/template-engine.git) project. Instructions for creating new media kits for translations are in that project's README.md.

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues for similar problems or feature requests
- Create a new issue for bugs or feature requests
- Include relevant details: browser, OS, steps to reproduce
